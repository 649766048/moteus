Design leg

Weigh all the gearbox components

Do mechanics to figure out what torque is necessary to jump given
linkage



# Master Plan #
 * Figure out correct dimensions for all 3d printed press fit interfaces
 * Build another single shapeways gearbox
 * If that works well enough, build 2 more 3d printed gearboxes
 * get 2dof leg jumping
 * get 3dof leg jumping

 * design custom gears, get prototyping run sufficient to build one mammal plus spares


DONE 2018-10-24
 * Finished updating gearbox with errata and bearing fit sizes

DONE 2018-10-20
 * Mounted gearbox to test plate
 * Mounted delrin plate to output shaft
 * Moderately hurt my finger when the VESC position mode control went bonkers
 * Measured torque at 1.5kg at 19cm, so 28.5kgf * cm, or 2.79 N*m,
   current on lab supply got up to 13A at 12V and motor got *very* hot
 * Ordered shapeways dimensional tests for each press fit interface
 * Ordered 2x of all necessary gears at sdp-si
 * Ordered 2x of all necessary gears at vxb.com


DONE 2018-10-19
 * Received AS5047 breakout, verified that it works with a bus pirate
 * Got AS5047 reading from the VESC
 * Wrote DMA based uart, untested on HW so far
 * assembled gearbox, with much dremeling

DONE 2018-10-17
 * Wrote string_span and string_view
 * Got some kind of test coverage, although apparently can't do host
   based unit test coverage with mbed
 * Wrote async_stream

DONE 2018-10-16
 * Received flat head screws for gearbox-3508 mount

DONE 2018-10-12
 * made flats on shaft
 * assembled shaft into 3508 with sdp-si spur gear
 * Modeled 3508 motor in freecad
 * Designed sensor mount
 * Ordered sensor mount from shapeways
 * Wired and powered up new VESC
 * Fixed ubuntu arm newlib so I can build firmware images

DONE 2018-10-11
 * Redrew planetary output stage with master sketch
 * Redrew 1st housing with master sketch for outside perimeter
 * Add lips to planet carriers to contact bearing sides
 * Design housing clamping mechanism
 * Design mount to stick two together in a leg
 * Design control board mount
 * Design magnetometer board mount
 * Ordered gearbox from shapeways
 * Order grease for gearbox
 * Ordered input and output bearings

DONE 2018-10-10
 * SDP-SI shaft fits in motor bearing

 * Built jig to pull motors, tested extracting a shaft from the 4112
   motor
 * Pulled shaft from 3508
 * Ordered more 3508s
 * Ordered 4mm shaft for 3508

DONE 2018-09-27
 * Get VESC to drive the 3508
 * Get VESC FOC mode to work in sensorless configuration

DONE 2018-09-26
 * Mounted the 3508 motors for unloaded test stand operation
 * Build cables to attach smaller motors to VESC


DONE 2018-09-24
