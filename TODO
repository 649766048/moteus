DONE 2019-03-19
 * Diagnosed 485 comms problem.  Turns out I had failed to properly
   assign servo 6 a non-1 ID
 * Fixed some other problems that turned up with 12 servos on the bus
   at the same time
 * Powered all the servos simultaneously for the first time!

DONE 2019-03-18
 * Ordered XT30 PCB mount connectors for eval
 * Built all robot-wide harnesses
 * Mounted all legs onto chassis

DONE 2019-03-17
 * Assembled and calibrated all 12 leg motors
 * Assembled legs except for pressing the shafts

DONE 2019-03-15
 * Populated all 27 remaining r3.1 controller boards
 * For one quad's worth of boards
   * Installed power leads
   * Applied Kapton
 * For half of the boards
   * Installed bullet connectors and heatshrink
   * (ran out of bullet connectors)
 * For all motors
   * Mounted magnets
   * Mounted in brackets

DONE 2019-03-14
 * Tried to rework in new regulators on the imu_junction board
   * The first one looked fine, but drew no current
   * The second one appeared to put 6.6V on the output, so maybe
     something was shorted out underneath?
   * Oh well, guess I will rev the board here quickly.
 * Completed local assembly of controller r3.1 SN 20
   * Got it mounted on a motor and calibrated!
 * Made McMaster and digikey order
 * ordered more 14awg wire and 3.5mm bullet connectors

DONE 2019-03-13
 * Worked towards asio and C++ client implementations of the multiplex
   register protocol.  Much refactoring and importing ensued.

DONE 2019-03-12
 * Received full run of controller boards
 * Got register server working in the servo, reads and writes from
   moteus_tool.py seem to be working fine.

DONE 2019-03-11
 * Wired up pi3 bridge, imu_junction board and servos
   * Verified I could communicate with servos through pi3 hat and
     imu_junction board
 * Wrote multiplex register server
 * Tried to get moteus into semaphore
   * I need python3.6, which they don't have
   * Trying to vendor python3.6 seems hard with current bazel, will
     wait for 0.24 or 0.25 to see if that fixes it

DONE 2019-03-10
 * pi3_hat
   * got bridging
 * Improved //:host target

DONE 2019-03-08
 * imu_junction
   * diagnosed errors with resynchronizations
   * the stm32 serial driver was taking too long to release the
     direction bit, causing a master collision between it and the
     servo.  Switched direction bit to be turned off in the ISR to get
     more consistent timing. Scope shows there is still plenty of
     margin (i.e. it isn't being turned off too soon).
 * pi3_hat
   * got power working, after adding a 100k pullup to regulator EN
     line... powered rpi3
   * created stub blinken-led firmware

DONE 2019-03-07
 * imu_junction
   * Fixed numerous software problems.  Bridging appears to be working
     about as well as necessary now, although still some seeming
     corruption that should be investigated
   * verified IMU was functional

DONE 2019-03-06
 * imu_junction
   * Built harness to connect to pi3 485 port
   * Discovered there was insufficient input capacitance to hot plug
     the board to a power supply through a test lead. :( Doubly so
     discovered since both boards regulators are now toast.  I have
     extra capacitance on one now, and a blue wire attaching in to the
     3.3v so that I can bring up the rest of the board while I wait
     for more regulators.
   * Disabled local echo on connector for RS485-plus4
   * Started work on imu_junction firmware.  Got basic
     telemetry_manager up and running, and sketched out bridge
     functionality, but it doesn't work yet.

DONE 2019-03-05
 * Created "one leg" panel to be printed on mk3s, kicked off a print

DONE 2019-02-26
 * Designed and ordered new controller backplate
 * Transcribed latest macrofab part selections back into eagle

DONE 2019-02-25
 * More endurance testing... came to conclusion bracket deformation
   was causing the shoulder failure.  Will test with beefier brackets
   once I get the heatsink plates made.
 * Ordered production run of controller boards, 28 of them!  Sadly, I
   will end up populating the same diode, LEDs and JST connectors,
   since it saves 3 weeks off the time.

DONE 2019-02-24
 * Completed endurance run twice up to 7 minutes... now twice have had
   the shoulder joint magnet seemingly go out of calibration.  It
   looks like it drifts semi-continuously while under load, and once
   it gets 0.5*pi out of phase then the jump starts failing.  Most
   mysterious, since that motor isn't even really being used.

DONE 2019-02-23
 * Wrote continuous jumping test driver
 * Rewired 485 runs on jumping fixture for improved reliability
 * Continuously jumped for over 7 minutes!

DONE 2019-02-22
 * Received r3 of controller
 * Installed DNP items on both r3 boards
 * Installed r3 controller and r3 leg onto jump fixture
   * Not sure if it is because of the new HW, but the belt doesn't
     track as well now, and rubs against the side of the upper leg
 * Jumped new leg a few times

DONE 2019-02-21
 * Ordered pi3 hat r2 from macrofab

DONE 2019-02-19
 * Ordered imu_junction r1 from macrofab

   with the current tibia gear ratio, we get about +-0.272 range of
   measurement
 * started work on IMU junction board... major parts selected and
   rough board layout complete

DONE 2019-02-16
 * Drafted design of chassis

DONE 2019-02-15
 * Ordered next revision of al bracket

       * 10A - 32C
       * 15A - 42C
       * 20A - 53C

       * 15A - 36C
       * 20A - 45C
       * 25A - motor got too hot steady state (90W of power)

DONE 2019-02-13
 * received r2 of mammal leg
   * Wow, it had even more problems than the first revision had
   * A lot of dremeling was required to get it to all fit together


DONE 2019-02-11
 * Ordered mcmaster parts for full robot build
 * Ordered vxb.com parts for full robot build
 * Discovered r2 upper leg was missing countersinks... fixed in the
   model, will just have to dremel away the first one
 * Ordered digikey parts to populate next controller boards
 * Did a lot of jump testing... rattled loose bolts holding be8108
   controller and be8108 itself.
 * Reduced switching noise some by switching to a windowed average
   velocity filter and adding a velocity threshold (at the expense of
   ringing when nearly stopped).  It is unclear this can be any better
   without a better encoder or a gear reduction.

DONE 2019-02-10
 * finished with r1 leg errata
 * ordered r2 leg from shapeways
 * ordered r2 belt from sdp-si along with some extra shafts

DONE 2019-02-09
 * Fixed most errata in 3d printed parts

DONE 2019-02-08
 * Assembled and mounted 3dof leg... maaaybe could be cantilevered?
   It is a little wobbly, but it seems like a fair amount of that is
   the linear rail carriage flexing.  I guess it wouldn't be too hard
   to try a 3d printed frame with cantilevered joints, and switch to
   one with the far side supported later.
 * Ordered first mech's worth of BE8108, Titan 6008, and 2x 5S Lipo
   packs

DONE 2019-02-07
 * Got animation of leg geometry and torque
 * Finished up calculations for mammal geometry

 * At 0.13/0.13 position (kp=1200)
   * 30A - 1.33kgf (0.155 position)
 * At 0.1/0.1 position (kp=1200)

   * 10A - 2.00kgf
   * 15A - 2.73kgf
   * 20A - >3.0kgf

DONE 2019-02-01
 * Wired up mammal leg, flashed both boards, and recorded video of it moving
 * w/ 50A, max force I was able to get on the plate was about 2.4kgf,
   although that still was very sensitive to deflection, as this
   geometry is much stronger when nearly straight.  An I term or
   feedforward force term could make the absolute force arbitrarily
   large at the expense of being unable to reject incoming forces.
 * At 0.1/0.1 position, got following forces per current
   * 10A - 0.52kgf
   * 20A - 0.82kgf
   * 30A - 1.1kgf
   * 40A - 1.25kgf
 * At 0.05/0.05 position (kp=1200)

   * 30A - 1.56kgf
 * At 0.02/0.02 position (kp=1200)
   * 10A - 1.32kgf
   * 20A - 2.02kgf
   * 30A - 2.36kgf

   * 120/240 - 53.4
 * Added CGA5L1X7R1V106K160AC on top of existing caps on SN11, set PWM
   rate to 60kHz and control rate to 30kHz.  Was able to do 50A
   continuous with only 2V ripple on the bus
 * Reworked all but one board to double stack the newer caps

DONE 2019-01-30
 * Designed and ordered busbar board from oshpark
 * Mounted leg sideways to bent plate
 * Optimized the PWM sampling code to greatly increase achievable duty
   cycle, and added hard monitoring that we are getting the sampling
   done before the FETs go high again.
 * Measured voltage ripple and temp performance of r2 controller at
   40kHz and 80kHz switching frequencies.
   * 80kHz w/ 60/120 drive strength
     * 5A, temp around 52.0C
     * 10A, temp around 66C
     * 40A, voltage ripple is about 2.40V
   * 40kHz
     * 5A, temp around 49.5C
     * 10A, temp around 56C
     * 20A, voltage ripple is about 1.92V
     * 30A, voltage ripple is about 4.2V
     * 35A, voltage ripple is about 6V

DONE 2019-01-29
 * Received mammal leg parts
 * Modified to achieve first fit, recorded errata
 * Mounted sn12 and sn13 on the Al brackets
 * Calibrated sn13
 * Fully assembled leg

DONE 2019-01-27
 * Ordered some TDK CGA5L1X7R1V106K160AC 10uF caps, which have a
   higher capacitance at a 12V bias voltage than the 22uF ones I had
   on the board.
 * Wired up scope probes to v+, M3 and debug out, took scope pictures
   of voltage ripple at 18A with 40kHz and 80kHz switching.

DONE 2019-01-25
 * Fixed D/Q current axis swap
 * Discovered that gbx2 motor must have gotten some retaining compound
   in the output bearing :(  It is now relatively sluggish.
 * Got cmdline utility to push calibrations working.  Re-flashed and
   re-calibrated all boards.
 * First shapeways pulley seems at least minimally functional
 * Tried jumping with 1kg load again... at 42a current gbx3 (using the
   r1 controller), always triggered a GDF fault, on the high side of a
   seemingly random phase.  I upped the drive current to 120ms, and
   tdrive to 2000ns to no avail.

DONE 2019-01-24
 * Continued working on cmdline utility

DONE 2019-01-23
 * Continued working on cmdline utility that can install
   calibrations... first re-implementing the multiplex protocol in
   python3 asyncio

DONE 2019-01-21

 * Created 6008 leg BOM
 * Ordered parts from SDP-SI
 * Ordered remaining shapeways parts for direct drive leg
 * Ordered direct drive leg bearings from vxb
 * Ordered low profile bolts from mcmaster
 * Increased velocity filter to reduce noise

DONE 2019-01-19
 * Actually applied loctite 680 to gbx2
 * Mounted and ran controller against xoar 6008.  Maybe?  30A gave
   1.02N*m of torque.  Probably worth building out a leg to see how
   much force it gets on the ground.  40A gave 1.28N*m, 45A gave 1.37N*m
 * Got direct drive leg good except for length

DONE 2019-01-18
 * Verified desired current rate limiting
 * Implemented temperature measurement for r2 controller

   a leg-like position

DONE 2019-01-13
 * Ordered experimental timing belt and pulleys

DONE 2019-01-12
 * Tested torque on MOAR Titan 6008... it is within the realm of
   plausible to use it purely direct drive.  It produces about 2.5 the
   torque of the 3508-580kv for the same current.

DONE 2019-01-11
 * Removed ms_i_error stuff
 * Ordered more usb cabling
 * Built first controller r2, updated firmware to use it
 * Installed it in jumping fixture and wired in 422 based debug output
 * Jumped with it for the first time!
 * Discovered voltage and drv8323 faults were only being checked when
   changing modes, not every sample as intended
 * Split up the config in bldc_servo so that things that are always
   different, like position limits, don't get reset as often.


DONE 2019-01-10
 * Tested jumping with 500g and 1000g of weight
 * Observed a gate drive fault when trying to jump with 40A of
   current, didn't look like the controller actually faulted for it
   correctly either
 * Ordered another 700g of weights to get to full load
 * NLGI #00 grease is too free flowing and leaks out the output
   bearing, guess I need to try #0

DONE 2019-01-09
 * Fixed gbx3, test fit the new controller mounting plate.  It largely
   worked, although it turned out there was no viable way to route
   phase wires inside enclosure.  Just ran them outside for now.
 * Tried jumping w/ 0.5kg weight.  It worked, but kept tripping the
   ms_i_error fault, need to get per-sample tracing working again
 * Received r2 control board

DONE 2019-01-07
 * Implemented current control fault
 * Resoldered gbx3 phase wires on back, inserted bullet in power
   lines, tried and failed to use the fully enclosed mounting
   hardware.

DONE 2019-01-06
 * Removed most of the NLGI#1 grease from both gearboxes and
   re-greased with #00.
 * Fixtured improved mechanism for holding power and communication
   wires to fixture
 * Tested out improved position control mode, velocity, nan starting
   position, and per-command p and d term scales

DONE 2019-01-05
 * Degreased both gbx2 and gbx3 shafts and pinions, re-assembled with
   loctite 243 both on set screw and on shaft/pinion interior.

DONE 2019-01-04
 * Tried to find a softer way to land... didn't have much luck
 * set screw in gbx3 came loose, re-loc-tited


DONE 2019-01-03
 * loc-tited set screw in gbx2
 * loc-tited screws holding leg to carriage
 * weighed 2 motor leg assembly at 600g
 * got tview to send simultaneous commands, now hit the top rail
   pretty hard with a 35A jump

DONE 2019-01-02

 * Ramped up current, at 37A it would ripple up to 54A or so and hit
   the top bumper on my linear rail.  No problems observed, aside from
   it being really hard to keep wires attached.  Air time about 450ms
   and when retracted legs got 30cm off the ground.

DONE 2019-01-01
 * Got FT4232 TTL working

   with loctite

DONE 2018-12-09
 * Try a feedforward in current loop
 * Optimize current measurement noise
 * Tune current control loop
 * Switched around gains to support more than 40A.  Was stable up to
   55A, but 60A looked like the controller wasn't liking itself no
   matter what gains I set.

DONE 2018-12-08
 * Got motor de-powered for many software faults
 * Tracked down remaining jitter to mbed Timer class.
 * Configured to not use the RTOS, since we didn't really need it
