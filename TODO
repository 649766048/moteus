Weigh all the gearbox components

Model 3508 motor in freecad
Design motor angle sensor mount

Bring up new VESC

Figure out why I can no longer build VESC firmware
Get VESC to use absolute magnetic position sensor

Do mechanics to figure out what torque is necessary to jump given
linkage

# Master Plan #
 * Build 1 3d printed sdp-si gearbox
 * If that works well enough, build 2 more 3d printed gearboxes
 * Otherwise, build an Al sdp-si gearbox
 * get 2dof leg jumping
 * get 3dof leg jumping

 * design custom gears, get prototyping run sufficient to build one mammal plus spares


DONE 2018-10-12
 * made flats on shaft
 * assembled shaft into 3508 with sdp-si spur gear

DONE 2018-10-11
 * Redrew planetary output stage with master sketch
 * Redrew 1st housing with master sketch for outside perimeter
 * Add lips to planet carriers to contact bearing sides
 * Design housing clamping mechanism
 * Design mount to stick two together in a leg
 * Design control board mount
 * Design magnetometer board mount
 * Ordered gearbox from shapeways
 * Order grease for gearbox
 * Ordered input and output bearings

DONE 2018-10-10
 * SDP-SI shaft fits in motor bearing
 * Test fit SDP-SI gear assembly

DONE 2018-10-09
 * Ordered micrometer
 * Ordered SDP-SI gearset

DONE 2018-10-01
 * Ordered gear design book

DONE 2018-09-30
 * Ordered VESC v6 w/ SPI connector
 * Ordered AS5047 breakout
 * Built jig to pull motors, tested extracting a shaft from the 4112
   motor
 * Pulled shaft from 3508
 * Ordered more 3508s
 * Ordered 4mm shaft for 3508

DONE 2018-09-27
 * Get VESC to drive the 3508
 * Get VESC FOC mode to work in sensorless configuration

DONE 2018-09-26
 * Mounted the 3508 motors for unloaded test stand operation
 * Build cables to attach smaller motors to VESC


DONE 2018-09-24

 * Build permanent cable from power supply to VESC
