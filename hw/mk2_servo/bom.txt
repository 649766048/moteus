# Assembly #

## Planet Output ##

1. IPA wipe
  a) bearing surfaces of planet output
  b) outside of planet output bearing
  c) inside of output bearing
2. Apply 7471 to:
  a) outside of planet output bearing
  b) inside of output bearing
3. Apply 638 to bearing surfaces of planet output
4. Mate planet output bearing and output bearing
5. Cure at 40C for 24hr

## Rotor ##

1. Rough surfaces w/ medium emory cloth
  a) outside of sun gear mating surface
  b) inside of rotor mating surface
2. Wipe with IPA until clean
  a) same two surfaces
3. Apply 7471 to outside of sun gear
4. Apply 638 to inside of rotor
5. Mate sun gear and rotor
6. Cure at 40C for 24hr

## Planet input ##

1. Wipe w/ IPA
  a) Shaft surfaces of planet input
  b) Outside of each shaft
2. Apply 7471 to outside of shaft near end
3. Apply 638 to shaft holes on planet input
4. Mate shafts into planet input
  a) use fixture planet output to align shafts
5. Cure at 40C for 24hr

## Front housing ##

1. Rough surfaces w/ medium emory cloth
  a) outside of internal gear
2. Adjust windings of stator
  a) no windings should be inside overall ID
  b) no windings should be present alongside steel center in region
     where lip exists
3. Wipe with IPA until clean
  a) outside of internal gear
  b) outside of output bearing
  c) output bearing surface on front housing
  d) internal gear surface on front housing
  e) stator surface on front housing
  f) inside of stator
4. Apply 7471 to
  a) outside of output bearing
  b) outside of internal gear
  c) inside of stator
5. Apply 638 to
  a) output bearing surface on front housing
  b) internal gear surface on front housing
  c) stator surface on front housing
6. Mate
  a) output bearing (including planet output assembly)
  b) internal gear
  c) stator w/ phase wires aligned to notch and facing towards front
     of front housing
7. Cure at 40C for 24hr
