* Front and back plates have an inconvenient length for bolts that
  hold should motors on.  Slightly too long to reliably use an M3x6
  and slightly too short to reliably use a M3x8.
* Cavity liner interferes with rpi antenna
* Cavity liner could be extended to cover the middle cavities too,
  unsupported is probably fine
