TODO
 * Verify that vert ZH connector fits on printout

r2 DONE
 * Updated revision to r3
 * made all 220 ohm resistors be 0402
 * Extended length of ZH pins by 1mm
 * Switched all the 15/22uF caps to the X7R 10uF one
 * Re-arranged all silks

r2 ERRATA
 * footprint for 6pin ZH vertical doesn't have trailing pins long
   enough, needs to be about 1mm longer
 * have a 0603 and a 0402 220ohm resistor!
 * Output capacitors are 80% derated at 12V!  Need to select something
   that has a higher effective capacitance at the intended input
   voltage and put more of them on the board, at least 12 total from
   the current 6.
   *  Maybe CGA5L1X7R1V106K160AC which is 5.84uF at 12.5v?, 4.18uF at 18V
     * the r2 board has C3216X5R1V226M160AC which is 4.9uF at 12.5, 3.3uF at 18V
     * the r1 board has C3216X5R1V156M160AC which is 3.9uF at 12.5, 2.6uF at 18V

r2 DONE
 * ABS connector are now holes
 * SWD connector is vertical
 * debug switched to RS422 and vertical ZH connector
 * have silks give pinout of RS485 connector
 * add onboard FET temperature sensor
 * Debug pins
  * a DAC output
  * motor1
  * pins for addition serial port
  * CUR1 (amplified)
  * gnd
  * motor terminals
  * Added PC13,14,15 as HW version pins
