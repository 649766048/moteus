r1 errata
 * would be nice to have a few debug through-holes
  * gnd
  * motor1
 * drv8323 SDO could use an external pullup for faster rise time

 * switch debug connector to a vertical ZH so that it can be used for
   a servo pair link
 * switch ABS pads to be through holes for easier soldering
 * switch SWD connector to be vertical and just expose on the back
 * add onboard FET temperature sensor
 * an additional unpopulated serial port for debugging
 * have silks give pinout of RS485 connector
