TODO


DONE 2019-04-16
 * sun gear holder could use some slight cutouts so that you could
   still bolt into some of the remaining rotor screws to assist in
   removal
 * sun gear holder needs some easier way to remove magnet, maybe just
   have a few wedges that actually contact it?  It shouldn't need much
   contact area.
 * sun gear holder rotor mount holes need to be smaller so that it
   holds the rotor in position better and maybe fine alignment won't
   be necessary?
 * sun gear holder sun gear tolerance should lean more towards a
   shrink fit rather than a slip fit... maybe +0.03 -0.02?
 * sun gear rotor bearing and input bearing should both be slip fits,
   so probably -0.01 -0.06
 * outer housing could use to be 0.1mm smaller in diameter at the back
   housing lip for a slightly snugger fit... reduced to OD+0.15mm
 * phase clamp wire hits the rotor, needs to be 2mm closer to the back
   of outer housing... moved 2.5mm closer to back
 * back cover does not have enough room for 3.5mm bullet to
   escape... increased from 5mm diameter to 5.75mm diameter (actual
   bullet appears to be 5.65mm diameter)

 * organized overall timeline... holy smokes fusion does not make
   that easy
 * Add lip for back housing to rest in front housing
 * Added absolute position board and wire channel

DONE 2019-03-30
 * Switched internal gear to 55mm outer diameter
 * Upped stator mating surface to 58.5
   * front housing mating surface on stator is slightly too small, I'm
     guessing the stator ID is 58.5mm, not the 58.4 I had modeled it as
     ... also, it appears the print may have shrunk to something like
     58.3 from the 58.4 I had specified

 * Added an additional 5mm of clearance behind stator mounting point.
   This reduces the backing material behind the M3 main mount inserts,
   but it isn't clear any backing material is necessary at all.
   * front housing doesn't *quite* have enough room for the phase wires
     at the back of the stator... perhaps I need to space the whole
     thing out a bit more, or make a slight 1mm of cavity in the front
     plate?  Probably need to space the whole thing out more as there is
     another wiring bulge a little away radially.  Need 5mm of gap
