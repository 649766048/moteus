TODO
  * figure out how to register the rotor back and forth... right now,
    it is just a loose press fit onto the shaft in the sun gear and
    the output shaft bearing, which allows it to relatively easily be
    pressed towards the front of the housing (the back is constrained
    by the back housing bearing lip)
  * back housing circumferential M2.5 bolts somehow are no longer in
    the center of the back housing!
  * planet output could use a tighter fit for output shaft bearing
  * flat screws in sun gear holder can protrude more than the bearing
    lip... at a minimum, need some clearance in the back housing so
    they can spin freely

  * need some way of identifying when stator is all the way installed
    properly... otherwise really hard to know if it is stuck, or
    seated
  * back housing, when 3d printed, needs a chamfer on the bottom
    printed surface and on the rotor bearing surface

DONE 2019-04-18
 * Added protrusion to back housing controller mount holes, so
   tensioning the bolts doesn't flex the board

DONE 2019-04-16
 * sun gear holder could use some slight cutouts so that you could
   still bolt into some of the remaining rotor screws to assist in
   removal
 * sun gear holder needs some easier way to remove magnet, maybe just
   have a few wedges that actually contact it?  It shouldn't need much
   contact area.
 * sun gear holder rotor mount holes need to be smaller so that it
   holds the rotor in position better and maybe fine alignment won't
   be necessary?
 * sun gear holder sun gear tolerance should lean more towards a
   shrink fit rather than a slip fit... maybe +0.03 -0.02?
 * sun gear rotor bearing and input bearing should both be slip fits,
   so probably -0.01 -0.06
 * outer housing could use to be 0.1mm smaller in diameter at the back
   housing lip for a slightly snugger fit... reduced to OD+0.15mm
 * phase clamp wire hits the rotor, needs to be 2mm closer to the back
   of outer housing... moved 2.5mm closer to back
 * back cover does not have enough room for 3.5mm bullet to
   escape... increased from 5mm diameter to 5.75mm diameter (actual
   bullet appears to be 5.65mm diameter)


DONE 2019-03-31
 * organized overall timeline... holy smokes fusion does not make
   that easy
 * Add lip for back housing to rest in front housing
 * Added absolute position board and wire channel

DONE 2019-03-30
 * Switched internal gear to 55mm outer diameter
 * Upped stator mating surface to 58.5
   * front housing mating surface on stator is slightly too small, I'm
     guessing the stator ID is 58.5mm, not the 58.4 I had modeled it as
     ... also, it appears the print may have shrunk to something like
     58.3 from the 58.4 I had specified

 * Added an additional 5mm of clearance behind stator mounting point.
   This reduces the backing material behind the M3 main mount inserts,
   but it isn't clear any backing material is necessary at all.
   * front housing doesn't *quite* have enough room for the phase wires
     at the back of the stator... perhaps I need to space the whole
     thing out a bit more, or make a slight 1mm of cavity in the front
     plate?  Probably need to space the whole thing out more as there is
     another wiring bulge a little away radially.  Need 5mm of gap
