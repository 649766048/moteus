TODO

 * outer housing could use to be 0.1mm smaller in diameter at the back
   housing lip for a slightly snugger fit

 * phase clamp wire hits the rotor, needs to be 2mm closer to the back
   of outer housing

 * sun gear holder could use some slight cutouts so that you could
   still bolt into some of the remaining rotor screws to assist in
   removal

 * sun gear holder needs some easier way to remove magnet, maybe just
   have a few wedges that actually contact it?  It shouldn't need much
   contact area.

 * sun gear holder rotor mount holes need to be smaller so that it
   holds the rotor in position better and maybe fine alignment won't
   be necessary?

 * sun gear holder sun gear tolerance should lean more towards a
   shrink fit rather than a slip fit... maybe +0.03 -0.02?

 * sun gear rotor bearing and input bearing should both be slip fits,
   so probably -0.01 -0.06

 * back cover does not have enough room for 3.5mm bullet to escape


TODO to switch to Aluminum

 * change general tolerances on all bearing interfaces, shaft
   interfaces, and front/back housing interface
   * output bearing
     * output planet
     * front housing
   * planet input bearing
   * spur gear output bearing
   * rotor bearing
     * spur gear holder
     * back housing
   * planet shaft holes
     * planet input and output
   * front/back interface

 * all holes where bolts fit through loosely need size adjusted to
   handle 0.005" tolerance of mating hole location


 * Switch all threads from inserts to threaded holes
   * front housing
     * main mounting holes
   * back housing
     * main mounting holes
     * cover mounting holes
     * controller mounting holes
     * front housing mounting holes
   * planet output
     * link stud thread


DONE 2019-03-31
 * organized overall timeline... holy smokes fusion does not make
   that easy
 * Add lip for back housing to rest in front housing
 * Added absolute position board and wire channel

DONE 2019-03-30
 * Switched internal gear to 55mm outer diameter
 * Upped stator mating surface to 58.5
   * front housing mating surface on stator is slightly too small, I'm
     guessing the stator ID is 58.5mm, not the 58.4 I had modeled it as
     ... also, it appears the print may have shrunk to something like
     58.3 from the 58.4 I had specified

 * Added an additional 5mm of clearance behind stator mounting point.
   This reduces the backing material behind the M3 main mount inserts,
   but it isn't clear any backing material is necessary at all.
   * front housing doesn't *quite* have enough room for the phase wires
     at the back of the stator... perhaps I need to space the whole
     thing out a bit more, or make a slight 1mm of cavity in the front
     plate?  Probably need to space the whole thing out more as there is
     another wiring bulge a little away radially.  Need 5mm of gap
