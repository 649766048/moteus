TODO
 * Fix front housing main body extrusion to go until it hits the back
   controller plate, not just for a fixed distance
 * Leave room for a 6.35mm flex PCB absolute position sensor around
   the planet output, along with a hole to run the wires down along
   with the phase wires

DONE 2019-03-30
 * Switched internal gear to 55mm outer diameter
 * Upped stator mating surface to 58.5
   * front housing mating surface on stator is slightly too small, I'm
     guessing the stator ID is 58.5mm, not the 58.4 I had modeled it as
     ... also, it appears the print may have shrunk to something like
     58.3 from the 58.4 I had specified

 * Added an additional 5mm of clearance behind stator mounting point.
   This reduces the backing material behind the M3 main mount inserts,
   but it isn't clear any backing material is necessary at all.
   * front housing doesn't *quite* have enough room for the phase wires
     at the back of the stator... perhaps I need to space the whole
     thing out a bit more, or make a slight 1mm of cavity in the front
     plate?  Probably need to space the whole thing out more as there is
     another wiring bulge a little away radially.  Need 5mm of gap
