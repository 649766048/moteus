gearbox v1 errata
 * spur gear extends too far lengthwise and interferes with inside of
   output gear
 * need some kinda of interlock to prevent housing 2 and output stud
   mounting bolts from going in too far
 * motor wire interferes with sensor bracket
 * housing 1
   * hole for spur gear is slightly too small, set screw of gear interferes
   * internal gear doesn't quite press fit into place, needs a tiny
     bit more space
 * housing 2
   * hole for output bearing is too small
   * output bearing hole needs a lip to keep the bearing from escaping
   * needed to be spaced away from housing 1 to leave enough room for
     output planet
   * mounting tabs leave bolt heads not flush with mounting surface
   * not thick enough for output bearing + lip

 * planet carrier input
   * hole for input bearing a bit too small
   * M2 screws for planet carrier have too big of a head to allow the
     input bearing to fit
 * planet carrier output
   * M3 retaining nuts can't fit in to slot
   * M2 retaining nuts holes are slightly too small
   * stud for output bearing too wide
   * stud for output bearing needs to be longer
 * feature requests
   * some way to mount a motor temperature sensor
   * some way to mount an absolute encoder on output or planet carrier
