r2 DONE
 * updated XT90 pins to be correct diameter
 * updated AMASS input to have correct polarity
 * fixed STM32 pinout to use QFN pinout instead of LQFP... stupid digikey
 * switched 10k 1% to actually be 10k 1% instead of a 10k thermistor

r1
 * main pins for XT90 right angle are approximately double the
   necessary diameter
 * input AMASS connector has wrong polarity
 * STM32 pinout doesn't match datasheet... grrrrh digikey
 * both resistor dividers have thermistors instead of 1% 10k resistors

---- OLD "precharge" board

r1

 * Add some kind of GPIO hole for a soft-switch
