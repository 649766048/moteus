 * Shoulder plate needs a bolt as close to the front as possible.
   Right now the there is a fair amount of room where one could go but
   isn't, and that flexes a moderate amount.

 * Made upper leg 0.5 shorter than optimal instead of 3mm shorter.
   Quick triangle math says that means the belt needs to be deflected
   about 5mm to reach full tension now.
 * Added chamfer on both sides of knee stud
 * Added 0.4mm gap between tension slideway and tension bracket
 * Added some chamfers to support the upper tension hole
 * Made upper bearing hole .5mm diameter bigger
 * Made tension bracket alignment tab 4mm, to match the shaft diameter
 * Added 1mm chamfer to bottom of tension bracket
 * tension bracket bottom needs chamfer, especially alignment pin, as
   it won't fit into the slot otherwise
 * increased tension bracket bolt void from 3mm to 4mm
 * split lower leg back into two parts so it can be printed laying
   down
 * chamfered the lower pulley by a mm

r1 problems


r1 DONE
 * knee stud needs chamfer on bottom
 * tension slot could probably use a little margin
 * upper leg, the insert hole for tension screw didn't print well at
   all on top, it had no support
 * upper bearing hole needs to be bigger
 * tension bracket alignment pin should be as wide as the shaft or a
   tad bit wider, so it doesn't matter if the shaft sticks out.
 * hole in bottom of tension bracket didn't come out big enough for a
   screw to go in
 * the lower leg has an unmanageable amount of support
 * the lower pulley is squished out a lot on the bottom surface
