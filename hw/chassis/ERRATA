 * Long part of stiffener could use to have more routing holes for
   wires further up from the bottom (well top) of the chassis

 * Battery stud contact mounting faces are collectively about 1mm too
   thick, so 0.5mm or 0.4mm needs to be taken off each side.
   * also need to taper the top of the outer face more, so that the
     contact can rest closer to the surface
