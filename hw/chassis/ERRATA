TODO
 * Split into multiple flat(er) plates for ease of assembly
  * front and back motor mounts
  * bottom plate
  * side plates
  * stiffeners
  * the side and front/back plates would bolt into inserts in the bottom plate
  * the stiffeners would have inserts, which would be screwed into
    from the front/back plate and bottom plate

 * maybe move imu junction board to be vertical and on one of the
   motor mount sides to make it easier to route cables out the front
   and top

 * Will want hard mounts for busbar boards

 * Motor bolt holes behind upper support bolt hole are unreachable
 * Motor bolt holes behind battery stud are nearly unreachable

 * Long part of stiffener could use to have more routing holes for
   wires further up from the bottom (well top) of the chassis

 * Battery stud contact mounting faces are collectively about 1mm too
   thick, so 0.5mm or 0.4mm needs to be taken off each side.
   * also need to taper the top of the outer face more, so that the
     contact can rest closer to the surface
