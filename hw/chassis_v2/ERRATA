r2 ERRATA
 * Battery stud
   * Battery has a really hard time snapping into place.  Possibly the
     retaining edges need to be a bit smaller?
   * Battery terminals don't mate with dummy plug without a fair
     amount of fiddling.  Also, really hard to solder in a battery
     terminal without finagling, as the plastic all melts

r2 DONE
 * Battery stud
   * fixed wire escape channel
 * M3 holes
   * Switched everything to M3LooseOD_1
 * Made bottom plate extend to other bolts
 * Added insert mounting pattern on top plate

r1 ERRATA

* Top plate
  * Needs mounting inserts for turret or other top features
* Battery stud
  * wire escape channel doesn't go all the way to the edge
* Nearly all M3 holes need to be M3 loose, not M3 tight
* Bottom plates
  * should be wider at the ends to attach to all bottom bolts
