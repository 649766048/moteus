TODO
 * Add physical switch connected to stm32
 * Add pre-charge fet/driver/resistor
 * Add power switch/ driver for motors and for PC
 * flyback diode ?

 * Maybe use TPH1R204PL,L1Q for FET switches
   * MIC4416 driver
   * 12V regulator ZXTR2012Z


r2 DONE
 * Switched 2.2uF input cap to 2x 10uF 35V (and changed the output cap
   to the same cap to minimize BOM count)
 * Added two FAN connectors driven by discrete FETs

r1 ERRATA
 * 3v3 regulator failed on both boards with a short from VIN to GND
   * likely cause was insufficient input capacitance
 * Will want connectors and drivers for fans

r1 DONE
 * draw power and ground planes
 * route power / ground
 * add title / copyright
 * align all parts
 * rough arrange silks
 * finalize BOM

DESIGN
   * battery in
   * 4 leg powers out
   * 4 leg rs485 out
   * power to computer
   * rs485 to computer
   * imu
   * buck converter for stm32f4
   * stm32f4 of some kind, w/ rs485 bridge
   * leds
