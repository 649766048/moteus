* Prepare front housing and outer housing stock on manual machines
  * outer housing
    * ID 95mm
    * OD 100mm
    * Length: 30.7mm
  * front housing
    * 22mm height
    * 5/8" center hole at least
    * 6mm front lip
    * 60mm max diameter past front lip
    * 46mm ID

* Planet Input
 * figure out what caused the pullout in op2 from the video

* Overall
 * phase wire clamp
 * back cover
 * get primary shaft to be correct length
 * make back housing out of Al
   * add weight cutouts in support ring

* Front housing
 * Strategy
   * Use the asylum's manual to face both sides of stock to a precision height
   * Drill a hole in the center
   * Create a fixture that mounts to the pocketNC and has a bolt hole in the middle
   * Hold the stock w/ hole to that
   * do the primary mounting holes/threads and outer housing holes/threads
   * Create a second fixture which bolts to the primary mounting holes
     using only 2 or 3 threads and then bolts to the pocket NC table
   * Do everything else in that setup

DONE 2019-10-31
 * Alignment indicates that I need to re-home before op2, as the B
   axis was mis-encoded
 * Tweaked toolpaths to spend less time clearing nothings and give
   slightly more clearance on moves

DONE 2019-10-30
 * front housing needs room for phase wires to come down
