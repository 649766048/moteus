TODO
 * Chassis obstructs installing RS485 connector for lateral leg, would
   be nice to have some free space to work with.

r4 DONE
 * Updated upper leg to be printable on FDM, now it no longer tapers
   in before going out again
 * Extended upper leg length to 129.65mm to account for FDM shrinkage
 * when printed on prusa. upper pulley hole of 4.1mm is just fine

r3 ERRATA
 * upper pulley center mounting hole is too small

r3 DONE
 * added back in upper leg mounting countersinks
 * switched lower clamp to have 8 pegs
 * increased lower pulley hole size from 3.15mm to 3.2mm
 * increased lower clamp separation from leg from 0.2mm to 0.3mm
 * increased lower clamp and lower leg hole diameter to 14.05mm
 * increased diameter of lower leg and clamp mounting holes from 3.1mm
   to 3.15mm
 * increased upper pulley center hole from 4.05mm to 4.1mm
 * increased pulley shank from 4mm to 4.3mm, and decreased pulley
   width from 7 to 6.7mm

 * added wire tie harness hole to al bracket

r2 ERRATA
 * bolt countersinks were broken in upper leg
 * clamp has the wrong number of mounting pins
 * holes in lower pulley could use to be a hair larger
 * lower clamp and lower leg hole is sized for a shaft, not for a
   bearing!
 * upper pulley center hole is a tad too small
 * upper pulley bearing binds between gear and motor

r2 DONE
 * be8108 modeled
 * made a cutout so femur can rotate a bit more

 * I had left 1.5mm clearance around the pulley to leave room for the
   belt.  Now going to leave 2.5mm of clearance.  pulley diameter of
   22mm
 * selected 120 tooth belt, which for a 24/44 pulley sdp-si's online
   calculator claims a center distance of 128.65mm

r1

 * al brackets need holes to tie wire harnesses to

 = DONE =

 * lower clamp needs a positive means of attaching, probably bolts
 * belt hits interior of lower clamp well before travel range is
   exhausted
 * Lower leg cover bottom mounting surface is a bit too long and interferes
 * All holes that need to have a pin in them are too small
 * increase lower pulley from 24 to 44
 * make leg slightly longer, probably 0.25m from the 0.232m it is now
 * make femur/tibia ratio more like 0.5 or 0.55 from the 0.48 that it is now
 * belt rubs against inside of upper leg, needs a mm or 2 more space
 * upper leg mounting holes for shaft will likely want a thicker
   section around where the shaft leaves in order to provide better
   lateral support
 * While can't make upper leg hole bigger, since it is a bearing
   interface, need to figure out some way to allow for inspection of
   proper belt fit... maybe just having more room and a window on the
   end would work?
 * Upper pulley bolt holes need to be big enough that bolts don't
   thread much
 * Upper pulley center hole needs to be larger diameter to give
   opposing motor sufficient clearance
 * Upper leg needs more clearance around belt hole for mounting
 * al bracket could use more material around motor mounting point to
   make it stiffer in torsion
 * would be nice if upper leg could rotate even more, so move 3rd axis
   motor higher and make additional cutout in al bracket
   * maybe not in the end... we don't have enough force for the motion
     we have
