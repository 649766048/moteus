 * All holes that need to have a pin in them are too small
 * Lower leg cover bottom mounting surface is a bit too long and interferes
 * Upper leg needs more clearance around belt hole for mounting
 * Upper pulley center hole needs to be larger diameter to give
   opposing motor sufficient clearance
 * Upper pulley bolt holes need to be big enough that bolts don't
   thread much

 * While can't make upper leg hole bigger, since it is a bearing
   interface, need to figure out some way to allow for inspection of
   proper belt fit... maybe just having more room and a window on the
   end would work?

 * Need M3x12 narrow head for upper pulley
 * upper leg mounting holes for shaft will likely want a thicker
   section around where the shaft leaves in order to provide better
   lateral support
 * belt hits interior of lower clamp well before travel range is
   exhausted
 * lower clamp needs a positive means of attaching, probably bolts
